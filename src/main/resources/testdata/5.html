            Pre-reading: Have you ever thought about the words that you use every day? Have you any favourite words?
            Perhaps you have even invented a new word some time?
        </p>

        <p>Have you heard any of these words before? See if you guess what they mean?</p>

        <h2>More and More Words</h2>

        <p>
            English is a rich language with respect to the number of words and according to The Global Language Monitor,
            English
            passed the millionth word on June 10th, 2009 at 10:22am GMT.
            They estimate that the English language is expanding by one new word every 98 minutes, while the Oxford
            English
            Dictionary increases its database with approx.
            4000 words per year. Both these organizations track and measure word usage around the globe.
            So, if you hear of a new word you can send information about it to Oxford Dictionaries.

        <h2>Where They Come From</h2>

        <p>
            Since English is a lingua franca, it seems to revel in the addition of new words from all sources.
            A new word would be just as likely to come from Australia, Pakistan, China or the US as from England.
            It could originate in the world of computers, science and technology, films, music or even in your local
            community.
